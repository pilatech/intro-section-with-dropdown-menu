## My process

 - Created markup based on desktop view (tried to be as semantic as possible)
 - Created mobile styles
 - Wrote JavaScript for interactivity which would work across all devices
 - To minimize JavaScript, all the code does is change CSS classes and the CSS deals with everything

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's wiser to think more before writing any code especially if you will need to scale
